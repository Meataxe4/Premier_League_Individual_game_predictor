# Premier_League_Individual_game_predictor
The code uses a Poisson regression model to predict the number of goals scored between two teams using xG data from Premier League Season 22/23.

The code then predicts the number of goals each team will score using the xG data. The code also simulates the match and calculates the probability of a home win, a draw, and an away win.
